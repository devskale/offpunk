## Git

Advanced users and developers may use the latest Git version.

```
git clone https://git.sr.ht/~lioploum/offpunk
```

Once cloned, no build is required. You can launch offpunk.py/opnk.py/ansicat.py/netcache.py directly.

Anyone using the git version should feel comfortable to report any bug on the devel mailing-list.
