# Offpunk History

## 1.3 - Unreleased
- Removed dependency to python-magic. File is now used directly (and should be on every system).

- Images are now downloaded before displaying an HTML page (can be disabled with "set download_images_first False")
- Introduced "set redirects" which redirects twitter,youtube,medium,reddit to alternative frontends.
- New behaviour for "find" (or "/") which is to grep through current page (ripgrep used if detected)
- Default width set to 80 as many gopherholes and gemini capsules have it hardcoded
- Streaming URL without valid content-length are now closed after 5Mo of download (thanks to Eoin Carney for reporting the issue)
- Gif animations are now displayed once when viewed (instead of a still frame).
- Restored some AV-98 certificate validation code that was lost I don’t know how.
- Improved clarity of dependencies in "version"
- Fixed a crash when the cache is already a dir inside a dir.
- Fixed a crash when manually entering an unknown gopher URL while offline
- Fixed an error with older less version
- Fixed bookmarks not being automatically created at first "add"

- requirements.txt has been contributed by Toby Kurien. Thanks!

## 1.2 - March 24th 2022
Very experimental release:
- Completely rewritten the HMTL, Gemtext and Gopher renderer. Tests needed!

Small improvements:
