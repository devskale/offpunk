## 0.4 - Feb 21st 2022

- Pictures are now displayed directely in terminal (suggested by kelbot)
- "open" command to open current page/image/file with external handler.

- RSS feeds are now rendered as Gemlogs to improve consistency while browsing
- "subscribe" will detect feeds in html pages if any
- "less" will restore previous position in a page (requires less 572+)
- Improved syncing performances and multiple bug/crash fixes.
- "version" will now display info about your system installation
- "info" command will display technical information about current page
- "sync" allows you to do the sync from within Offpunk

New Features:

- "less full" allows to see the full html page instead of only the article view

- Option --disable-http to allows deep syncing of gemini-only ressources
- Vastly improved HTML rendering with support for images (you need the binary "chafa" on your system)
Other Small Improvements:
- Disabled https_everywhere by default (caching problems and some websites not supporting it)

- Caching more problems to avoid refetch
