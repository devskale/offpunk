## 0.4 - Feb 21st 2022
UPGRADE: Users who subscribed to pages before 0.4 should run once the command "list subscribe subscribed". Without that, the subscribed list will be seen as a normal list by sync.

- Pictures are now displayed directely in terminal (suggested by kelbot)
- "open" command to open current page/image/file with external handler.
- "set width XX" now works to set the max width. If smaller, terminal width is used (thanks kelbot for reporting the bug)
- RSS feeds are now rendered as Gemlogs to improve consistency while browsing
- "subscribe" will detect feeds in html pages if any
- "less" will restore previous position in a page (requires less 572+)
- Improved syncing performances and multiple bug/crash fixes.
- "version" will now display info about your system installation
- "info" command will display technical information about current page
- "sync" allows you to do the sync from within Offpunk

## 0.3 - Feb 11th 2022
New Features:
- Gopher supported natively (early version, might have many bugs)
- support for RSS and Atom feed (you can subscribe to them)
- "less full" allows to see the full html page instead of only the article view
 	(also works with feeds to see descriptions of each post instead of a simple list)
- Option --depth to customize your sync. Be warned, more than 1 is crazy.
- Option --disable-http to allows deep syncing of gemini-only ressources
- Vastly improved HTML rendering with support for images (you need the binary "chafa" on your system)
Other Small Improvements:
- Disabled https_everywhere by default (caching problems and some websites not supporting it)
- Modified --sync logic to make it more intuitive (thanks Bjorn Westergard)
- Caching more problems to avoid refetch
- Offpunk has now an User-Agent when http browsing to avoid being blocked as a bot
- Changed XDG logic to improve compatibility (thanks Klaus Alexander)
