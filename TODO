# Godo first contributions

## Cache Triming  (Good first-contribution - medium level)

We need work on a model that keep the cache within certain limit by removing older, inaccessed elements which are not linked to anything in lists.

This is a good first-contribution issue as the cache-triming script should be completely independant and interact little with existing code.

## HTML rendering  (Good first-contribution - advanced level)

Better rendering of tables using ASCII tables.

This is a good first-contribution for someone interested in HTML parsing/rendering and ready to dig into ansicat. While quite complex, the issue will have little or no interaction with code outside of the HTML rendering engine of Ansicat.
